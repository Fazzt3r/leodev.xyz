Welcome to the new website.

I totally reworked the website and the documentations.


Changes:

- Abandoned python and sphinx
  - Sphinx was really restricting and didn't work with multiple documentations at all.
- Using [handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - handlebars.js' syntax is close to Jinja 2 which I'm familiar with, so I chose it (and it's really *really* customizable).
  - Tailwind CSS is the future!
- Changed from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
  - Cloudflare Pages greatly simplified the build process.


New features:

- Blog
- Aimware V5 Documentation
- Scripts directly on the website
- Automatically generated snippets
